This is a three-screen interactive videogame which combines agility and reflexes in a new way of understanding speedrun videogames. To play, ideally there should be three XGA projectors (1024 x 768) and three screens (2.5 x 2 m) forming an angle of 90 degrees with each other. In terms of interactivity, a PS Move controller and PS Eye cameras connected to a PC with PS Move Service are needed. Moreover, it is advisable to have a Full HD RGB webcam with which we can extract the skeleton, face, and hands of the player through Media Pipe. Finally, it is essential to have three Raspberry Pi 4 that sends information to each projector.
